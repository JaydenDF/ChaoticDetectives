    DialogueText: She's been the dearest girl. Her resilience and ever-present smile
      still linger in my memory. She loved photography, capturing even the smallest,
      most mesmerizing moments. Her strong spirit touched everyone she met, gracing
      strangers with her smile until they smiled back. Let's find her, so we can
      restore the light she brought and make this a better place.
