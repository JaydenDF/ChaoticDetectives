    DialogueText: Oh well... I tried to arrange the canned goods in the back aisles,
      but they fell to the floor and started rolling all over the place. Thankfully,
      the customers pitched in to help gather them... though I'm certain I'm still
      missing at least two... ha ha, must be those neighbor kids.

    DialogueText: What a beautiful piece! Oh... Ivy used to play "Go" almost every
      evening in the park. I was always concerned because the people she played with
      were never her age... but, well... games bring people together, and perhaps
      there is still someone who knows Ivy.
