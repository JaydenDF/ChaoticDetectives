    DialogueText: I haven't felt this way since I lost my wife. It feels as my body
      is shaking with the urge to help, although my hands are still. Huh... But who
      knew that such a sorrowful event could ignite a passion for change? So many
      people have been visiting and trying to help. I hope it leads to the betterment
      of us all.

    DialogueText: I recall seeing a shadow of something, something that seemed frightening
      and partially inhumane. I remember it looming behind Ivy almost every day.
      But sadly, I don't remember where I saw it, in the bedroom or at school.
