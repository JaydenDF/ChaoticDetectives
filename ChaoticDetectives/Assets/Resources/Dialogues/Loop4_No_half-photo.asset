      too... as sometimes without a reminder, I cannot recall Ivy''s smile. Perhaps
      you can find a trinket? Something that will remind me of how beautiful she
      was!'

      is shaking with the urge to help, although my hands are still. Huh... But who
      knew that such a sorrowful event could ignite a passion for change? So many
      people have been visiting and trying to help. I hope it leads to the betterment
      of us all.

    DialogueText: She's been the dearest girl. Her resilience and ever-present smile
      still linger in my memory. She loved photography, capturing even the smallest,
      most mesmerizing moments. Her strong spirit touched everyone she met, gracing
      strangers with her smile until they smiled back. Let's find her, so we can
      restore the light she brought and make this a better place.
